        <strong>Oldies Stations</strong>
        <br> Only consistency in your periphery
        <br> Is fear and the bridge of your nose
        <br> And as you move about, you learn to tune 'em out
        <br> But they say they continue to grow

        <br> Fear of the past and (Relative pain)
        <br> Future's comin' fast, you've got (Nothin' in the tank)
        <br> In a season of purging things you used to love
        <br> Everything must go, mm-hm

        <br> Make an oath, then make mistakes
        <br> Start a streak you're bound to break
        <br> When darkness rolls on you
        <br> Push on through
        <br> Push on through

        <br> Then before you know, you lose some people close
        <br> Forcing you to manage your pace
        <br> Found your capacity for love and tragedy
        <br> Embracing how things always change

        <br> You've had your turns with (Relative pain)
        <br> Little less concerned when there's (Nothin' in the tank)
        <br> In a season of lessons learned in giving up
        <br> You learn what you can and can't take, mm-hm

        <br> Add some years, build some trust
        <br> You start to feel your eyes adjust
        <br> When darkness rolls on you
        <br> Push on through
        <br> Push on through

        <br> You don't quite mind
        <br> You don't quite mind
        <br> You don't quite mind how long red lights are takin'
        <br> Push on through
        <br> Your favorite song was on the oldies station
        <br> Push on through
        <br> You have it down, that old fight for survival
        <br> Push on through
        <br> You're in the crowd at her first dance recital
        <br> Push on through (Ro', Ro', Ro', Ro')

        <br> Make an oath, then make mistakes
        <br> Start a streak you're bound to break
        <br> When darkness rolls on you
        <br> Push on through

        <br> Ooh
        <br> Ooh
        <br> Ooh
