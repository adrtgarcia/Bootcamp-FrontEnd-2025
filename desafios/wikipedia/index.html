                <strong>Clancy</strong> is the seventh studio album by the American musical duo <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_One_Pilots">Twenty One Pilots</a>, 
                released on May 24, 2024, through Fueled by Ramen and Elektra Records. Titled after the protagonist introduced in their fifth 
                studio album, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trench_(album)"><i>Trench (2018)</i></a>, the visual album is the first of 
                two records ending the duo's decade-long conceptual series which began with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blurryface"><i>Blurryface (2015)</i></a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Written by frontman Tyler Joseph and produced with frequent collaborator Paul Meany, Clancy was announced on February 29, 2024, 
                following weeks of speculation. Four singles preceded the album's release: "Overcompensate", "Next Semester", "Backslide", and "The Craving". 
                Clancy received positive reviews from critics and reached number one on the album charts in Australia, Germany and Scotland, number two in the UK, 
                number three in the US, and the top five in various other countries. To support the album, the band embarked on the Clancy World Tour, which began in August 2024.

            <p>
                In February 2021, while promoting Twenty One Pilots's sixth studio album <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scaled_and_Icy"><i>Scaled and Icy (2021)</i></a>, 
                lead singer Tyler Joseph revealed that the album's closing track "Redecorate" acts as "an intentional hint at what he wants to 
                try to do next", contrasting the song's more ominous tone with the "brand new, sparkling, happy, colorful" sound of its 
                parent album. In a September 2022 interview, Joseph initially stated that the band's next album would conclude the storyline of the 
                character Clancy and the fictional city of Dema that were introduced in their fifth album <i>Trench (2018)</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                On February 15, 2024, the cover art of <i>Scaled and Icy</i>, <i>Vessel</i>, <i>Blurryface</i> and <i>Trench</i> were updated to be 
                partially concealed with red tape on streaming platforms. Shortly after, people began to post on their social media that they had received 
                mail from the band containing cryptic letters. Around the same time, billboards and posters in numerous countries (such as Spain, Canada 
                and Poland) began displaying a new band logo.

            <p>
                On February 22, 2024, the band released a narrated video on their social media platforms, titled "I Am Clancy". In the video, the narrator, 
                who reveals himself to be Clancy, summarizes the story of the previous three albums and his multiple attempts to escape from Dema; he ends the 
                video by stating that he would be "returning to Trench". Clancy was officially announced on February 29, 2024, with its release initially 
                set for May 17. Its lead single, "Overcompensate", was released on the same day.

                On March 18, Joseph announced that each song on the album would have an accompanying music video, with all set to be released alongside the album; 
                its release was subsequently delayed by a week due to the production timeframe required to complete the videos. Despite this, the band announced listening 
                parties that would take place in selected stores through various countries, between May 18 and May 23, before the album's release.

                And that's what we're gonna do, because that's how I want to present this album."

            <p>
                The second single, "Next Semester", was released on March 27. The third single, "Backslide", was released on April 25. 
                On May 9, the band debuted "The Craving" live during their small-scale concert at the Electric Ballroom in London. The 
                song was released on May 22 as the fourth single; this version is subtitled "(Single Version)" in contrast to the album's 
                "(Jenna's Version)", and features different instrumentation and production.
            </p>
            <p>
                On May 24, the day of the album's release, the band premiered the music video for 10 songs of the album (excluding those for 
                the singles, which had already been released) on YouTube through a livestream, wherein the band offered insights into the creation 
                of each song and its respective video. Each video was individually uploaded to the band's YouTube channel independent of the 
                livestream after its premiere. On May 29, the band released an online-only collection, titled Clancy – Digital Remains, which 
                includes live versions of the four singles and several pages containing new photos and "artifacts" in relation to the making of the album. 
                The music video for "Paladin Strait", the album's closing track, was released on June 21 and directed by Jensen Noen.

                On September 19, the duo performed "Routines in the Night" on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. The performance was recorded 
                in advance, airing as the closer of the episode.
            </p>

            <h3 id="composition"><a href="#clancy">⬆️</a> Composition and Themes</h3>
            <p>
                Debra Kate Schafer of The Aquarian Weekly described Clancy as an "amalgamation" of every iteration of Twenty One Pilots' artistry. 
                It is an alternative rock, pop rock, hip-hop, synth-pop, bedroom pop, emo rap, indie rock, and garage rock album that blends rock and roll 
                musicianship, subtle hip hop directions, and an "all-encompassing" pop-stylized atmosphere. The album was primarily composed and 
                produced by Joseph and frequent collaborator Paul Meany, with additional writing contributions from Jake Torrey on "Routines in the Night". 
                Five of the album's thirteen tracks were written entirely by Joseph. Several songs were originally written on the baritone ukulele before 
                they were arranged on other instruments, such as the bass guitar.
            </p>
            <p>
                Like previous works in the series, Clancy is framed in the metaphorical world of "Trench" and the dystopian city of "Dema". It 
                follows the titular character as he returns to Trench to free his fellow citizens of Dema after he escaped and was granted a "miraculous power".

            <p>
                Clancy's accompanying storyline resumes in its opener "Overcompensate", a 1990s-tinged rocktronica track driven by synthesizer 
                layers, hip hop stylings, and a "racing" breakbeat. The track is also the first one that the band finished while they were working 
                on the album. Its upbeat production continues with the punk-infused garage rock tune "Next Semester", which details a panic attack 
                Joseph suffered as a college student. "Backslide" is a hip hop and rap rock track that elevates itself with echoing and morphed 
                background vocals and "nonchalant" spoken verses, broken up by a "grueling" and "emotive" chorus. Conceived as a "love letter" to 
                the band's home state and region, "Midwest Indigo" is a "thrilling" and "joyous" pop-punk track. Opening with a "reverberating" alarm, 
                "Routines in the Night" contains subtle vocal mannerisms that pays homage to "The Run and Go", a track from Vessel (2013). 
                "Vignette" serves as a direct homage to Trench, with recurring themes of death, rebirth, decay and awakening—changing from moments of isolation 
                to the culminating finale of a layered and crowded admission of "no, not me, it's for a friend". "The Craving (Jenna's Version)" is 
                a tender acoustic piece written for Joseph's wife Jenna, which presents itself as an "ode to the imperfections of such a strong emotion, 
                and that even in the existence of tragedy and self-doubt, love prevails".
            </p>
            <p>
                "Lavish" is a dream pop track that brings "funk and flair" to the record, and is punctuated by "hypnotic rap verses" and includes a "hearty 
                bassline". "Navigating" is a dance-rock and synth-rock track reminiscent of Bloc Party, which is propelled by "relentless drumming" from Dun. 
                "Snap Back" includes references to previous songs such as "Heavydirtysoul" and "Backslide", with vocals that are "smooth yet rugged". 
                "Oldies Station" is a "simple, feel-good" track, wherein Joseph encourages the listener to "push on through". "At the Risk of Feeling Dumb" 
                presents the duo at "their heaviest" on the album, with an "earwormy chorus" and "vivid repetition". The album closes with "Paladin Strait", 
                a track containing whirring synths that are partnered with "beautiful guitar chords", which are described as feeling like a "voyage, a grand 
                adventure in which its soft plucking and gentle strums usher you forward on a glorious but daunting journey".
